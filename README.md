# Weather-App

# Description

I created an application where the user can enter a city name and receive the  current 5 day forecast for that city
the user will be met with several cards that display each days forcast with the temp, the humidity level, and current weather

# Uses

When the user loads the application they are met with a input field and a subnit button. 
When the user inputs a city name into the input field and clicks submit the 5 day forecast is displayed in cards underneath
The user can then enter a new city into the input field and receive the 5 day forecast for the new city
